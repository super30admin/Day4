## Problem 2: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
Find the minimum element.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

Approach:
- In this problem we use a modified binary search.
- We use a special property of a rotated sorted array. 
  The property is that when a rotated sorted array is split in 2 halves, atleast one half is sorted.
- We fist see the middle element, if the middle element is smaller than both its adjacent neighbours,
  it means it's the mininum value in the array.
- If not, we look for the sorted subarray on both the sides (by simply comparing the fisrt and last value) 
  and return the leftmost value in the sorted subarray.

Time Complexity: O(logn)
Space Complexity: O(1)
