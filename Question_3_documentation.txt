I perform BS on the array and in every iteration, at the middle point, I am checking if the midpoint is in ascending order, descending order
or peak or valley. If it is in ascending order, there is a guarantee that the peak will exist on the right side, if it is descending 
then there is guarantee that the peak would exist on the left side. If it is a peak then we will return the midpoint index
