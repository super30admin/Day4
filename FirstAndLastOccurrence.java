/**
 * Approach: Binary Search
 *
 * Working:
 *      FindFirstOccurrence
 *          - calculate mid, and if the target is found in mid,
 *              - check if the PREVIOUS VALUE i.e (arr[mid-1] != target) in the array is not the same as the target
 *              i.e this is to ensure that the current index is the FIRST LEFT MOST OCCURRENCE of the element
 *                  return mid as the first occurrence
 *
 *              - assume that the current index IS NOT THE FIRST INDEX in the array
 *                  then move the high pointer the left part of the array and perform Binary Search
 *          - remaining condition similar to a regular binary search
 *
 *
 *     FindSecondOccurrence
 *          - calculate mid, and if the target is found in mid,
 *              - check if the NEXT VALUE i.e (arr[mid +1] != target) in the array is not the same as the target
 *              i.e this is to ensure that the current index is the LAST RIGHT MOST OCCURRENCE of the element
 *                  return mid as the LAST OCCURRENCE
 *
 *              - assume that the current index is NOT THE LAST INDEX in the array
 *                  then move the LOW POINTER the RIGHT PART of the array and perform Binary Search
 *          - remaining condition similar to a regular binary search
 *
 *
 *     return {firstIndex, lastIndex};
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(long n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
